# Res-Net

A few general / hybrid ResNet Models I've produced for a variety of projects. There is both a 1D-ResNet and a 2D-ResNet (1D meaning 1-dimensional convolutional layers were used, 2D meaning 2-dimensional convolutional layers were used).

I did not intend to make these models exactly as the paper intended, as some of them were used in specific projects I've been working on.
